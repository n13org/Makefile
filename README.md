## Introduction
The command ```make``` calls targets from a [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)). The Makefile should be placed on root-level, or can be refered by the parameter ```make -f```. The first target in the Makefile is the default target and will be executed, when make is called without target.
